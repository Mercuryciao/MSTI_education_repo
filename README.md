## Problem Statement

Field Technicians work on cell sites conducting equipment installation, maintenance, and repair daily. Professional training for hands-on skills is essential, but the current process heavily relies on senior field technicians to instruct new hires. This consumes a significant amount of seniors' time and poses challenges for new hires to access training guidance.

**Objective:** Leverage Mixed Reality (MR) to facilitate Nokia Airscale training for Field Technicians, harnessing the benefits of shadowing an experienced technician.

## Solution

An MR application that trains field technicians for better efficiency, providing real-time insights and guidance on Nokia AirScale operations before they undertake fieldwork independently.

**Key Features:**

- Real-time guidance & feedback
- Personalized learning pace
- Step-by-step instructions
- Sync progress with managers
